# Overview

This package helps to connect to Google Gemini API. It has the following features:

- Authentication through API key
- Direct access to the API
- Flow steps to common calls
- Helpers to make it easier to use Google Gemini from your app

Keep in mind that OAuth authentication is not supported so far. This means it is not possible to use the API for semantic retrieval.

# Configuration

These are the configuration parameters:

- `API Key`: this is the API key for Google Gemini. For more information on how to get it, please look at its documentation [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
